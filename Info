Solution for Questions:
1. What other scenarios would you suggest for the given page? List 3-5 suggestion
	> Scenario with 'Single' appplication type and 'Residential Investment' as property would you like to buy
	> Scenario with 'Joint' appplication type and 'Residential Investment' as property would you like to buy
	> Scenario with 'Joint' appplication type and 'Home to live in' as property would you like to buy
	> Scenario with 'Joint' application type and passing '2nd applicant's annual income (before tax)' as $0 and '2nd applicant's annual other income' as $0
	
2. If this test was part of the much larger test suite, how could you run a specific test or subset/group of test
	>Since this framework in using TestNg we can execute the suite in gropus with parallel execution

3. Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before the automated test attempts to click a button on a web page. How would you improve reliability of these tests without increasing execution time?
	>We can use explicit and fluent wait to handle the unpredicted conditions for failure. We can use the rerun of failed scenarios
